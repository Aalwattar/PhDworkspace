GA
================================================================================
Implementation of a simple Genetic Algorithm for scheduling optimization



TO RUN:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OfflineScheduler.exe [options]

[options]
-a FILE
        Use FILE as library of architectures (please see bellow for formatting 
        restrictions)

-b NAME
        Use the algorithm NAME to perform crossover. Current options are:
            one-point
            two-point

-c DECIMAL_NUM
        Set the crossover rate to DECIMAL_NUM
    
-d FILE
        Use FILE as the DFG file (usually contains a .aif extention)

-g INTEGER
        Run the genetic algorithm for INTEGER generations

-m DECIMAL_NUM
        Set the mutation rate to DECIMAL_NUM

-n NAME 
        Use the algorithm NAME to perform mutation. Current options are:
            random
            rotationally

-p INTEGER
        Set the Population size to INTEGER individuals

-r NAME
        Use the algorithm NAME to perform replacement. Current options are:
            all
            keep_best

-s NAME
        Use the algorithm NAME to perform selection. Current options are:
            random
            tournament

-t INTEGER
        Seed the random number generator with INTEGER

-w DECIMAL_NUM
        Set the weighting of the schedule's runtime in the fitness function
        (The power weight is automatically calculated to be (1.0 - runtime weight) )


- These arguments are all optional and can be entered in any order.
- more options are currently in development


DEFAULT VALUES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default Values
- Architecture Library file = input/architecture_library.txt
- DFG = input/B1_10_5.aif

- Crossover rate = 0.85
- Crossover Algorithm = one point crossover
- Mutation rate = 0.005
- Mutation Algorithm = rotational mutation

- Population size = 50
- Number of Generations = 500

- Selection Algorithm = Tournament selection
- Replacement Algorithm = Keep best

Program Output
- Error messages are currently being printed to stderr
- All other program output is printed to stdout


CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DFG should be generated by Ahmed's taskGenerator
  
The Crossover rate should be a decimal number between 0 and 1
The Mutation rate should be a decimal number between 0 and 1

The Population size should be a number between 2 and 10000
The number of generations should be greater than 1


ARCHITECTURE FILE FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The very first line in the file MUST be as follows:
    Num_Tasks= #
        # = the number different tasks that this file contains  

The properties of each task must be entered in the following order:  
<NAME> <COLUMNS> <ROWS> <CONFIGURATION_TIME> <EXECUTION_TIME> <CONFIGURATION_POWER> <EXECUTION_POWER>

- each property must be an integer separated by one or more whitespaces

Lines beginning with # are ignored by the parser  

All implementations of the same task MUST have the exact same name (eg. TASK2)
- I assume that there is only one GPP architecture, and it always appears in the
    architecture library file before all hardware implementations of that same
    type.


FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION IDEAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###Migration of software tasks to hardware
- The GA and architecture files currently have the potential to support the
    migration of software tasks to hardware. 
- I currently assume that the GPP architecture exists, but simply never choose
    it when creating individuals or using the generational operators

- Napoleon on the other had does not.
