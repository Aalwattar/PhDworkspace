Implementation of a simple Genetic Algorithm for scheduling optimization



TO RUN:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OfflineScheduler.exe [options]

[options]
    -a FILE
        Use FILE as library of architectures (please see bellow for formatting 
            restrictions)

    -c DECIMAL_NUM
        Set the crossover rate to DECIMAL_NUM
        
    -d FILE
        Use FILE as the DFG file (usually contains a .aif extention)

    -g INTEGER
        Run the genetic algorithm for INTEGER generations

    -m DECIMAL_NUM
        Set the mutation rate to DECIMAL_NUM

    -p INTEGER
        Set the Population size to INTEGER individuals

    -t INTEGER
        Seed the random number generator with INTEGER


- These arguments are all optional and can be entered in any order.
- more options are currently in development


DEFAULT VALUES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default Values
    - Architecture Library file = input/architecture_library.txt
    - DFG = input/B1_10_5.aif

    - Crossover rate = 0.85
    - Mutation rate = 0.005

    - Population size = 50
    - Number of Generations = 500


Program Output
    - Error messages are currently being printed to stderr
    - All other program output is printed to stdout


CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DFG should be generated by Ahmed's taskGenerator
  
The Crossover rate should be a decimal number between 0 and 1
The Mutation rate should be a decimal number between 0 and 1

The Population size should be a number between 2 and 10000
The number of generations should be greater than 1


ARCHITECTURE FILE FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The very first line in the file MUST be as follows:
    Num_Tasks= #
        # = the number different tasks that this file contains  

The properties of each task must be entered in the following order:  
    <NAME> <COLUMNS> <ROWS> <CONFIGURATION_TIME> <EXECUTION_TIME> <CONFIGURATION_POWER> <EXECUTION_POWER>

    - each property must be an integer separated by one or more whitespaces

Lines beginning with # are ignored by the parser  

All implementations of the same task MUST have the exact same name (eg. TASK2)
